<p>
<b>Tiny Troves of Dev Wisdom</b> is a mini game made in Unity 2D. It was created as a beginner-friendly project for <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> 2023. 
</p>
<p>
The game is a collection of bite-sized pieces of wisdom for developers of all ages and skill levels.

<h2>How to contribute to the project</h2>
<p><b>Have a valuable tip, a clever shortcut, or a lesson learned in the trenches of development? Here's how you can contribute to this project</p></b>
<p>This project has been designed with non-Unity developers in mind. No knowledge of the Unity interface is required!  
</p>
<p>To contribute to this project, we ask that you add your name and piece of developer advice to a <code>Advice.txt</code> file in the repo. For a step-by-step guide on how to do this, please see the project's <a href="/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contributing Guide</a></p>
<p>No matter where you are on your coding journey, there's a place for you here. Before contributing, please review the project's <a href="/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code Of Conduct.</a></p>
<h2>How to view the current game build</h2>
<p>You can view the current game build <a href="https://mystic-mill-games.itch.io/tiny-troves-of-dev-wisdom">here</a>.
  <p>If you have recently made a contribution but can't see it in the current build, it's probably because the build hasn't been updated yet.</p>
<p>Since Unity builds can only be generated by someone who has Unity installed locally on their machine, I will be deploying new builds regularly throughout Hacktoberfest so that everyone gets a chance to see their contributions.</p>
